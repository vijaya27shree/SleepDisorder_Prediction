### Project Overview
A sleep disorder is a medical condition that affects an individual's ability to have a healthy and restorative night's sleep. Sleep is an essential part of our daily routine, and disturbances in this natural process can have profound impacts on physical, mental, and emotional well-being. There are various types of sleep disorders, each characterized by distinct symptoms and underlying causes.

This Sleep Disorder Prediction App would help health insurance company to identify whether or not a potential client is likely to have a sleep disorder. The company would be able to use this information to determine the premium they want the client to pay.

### Tools

 - Scikit-learn
 - Jupyter notebook - Coding Environment
 - Vscode

### Data Cleaning
In the data preparation phase, i performed the following tasks;

1. Data loading
2. Data Validation
3. Data cleaning
4. Handling Missing Data

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the Patient Sleep Disorder Data to answer key questions such as;

 - What is the distribution of Sleep duration by Occupation.
 - What is the distribution of Sleep quality by Occupation.
 - What is the influence of Physical activity on the Quality of Sleep.
 - What is the impact of sleep disoreder on the the quality of sleep.
 - Does Age affects the quality of sleep of an individual.
    
### Supervised Machine Learning
Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that the input data is paired with corresponding output labels. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping or relationship between input features and their corresponding output labels, allowing the algorithm to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. .  
Linear SVC and Logistic Regression achieve the highest accuracy scores, indicating their effectiveness in classification tasks.
